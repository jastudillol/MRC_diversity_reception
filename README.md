# MRC_diversity_reception
Mobile Ad-hoc Networks exhibit a limited wireless transmission range due to the interference present in the channel and the packets lost due to transmission errors. In this work, we evaluate the diversity reception technique to overcome the problems that arise with these networks, given their wireless nature. Diversity reception is a common technique in many radio communication systems, fixed or mobile, which improves signal reception quality. We use a single Nakagami-m channel to model the resulting received signal after using Maximum Ratio Combining (MRC) to the copies of the transmitted signal. Although MRC is a well-known diversity technique, to the best of our knowledge, diversity reception has not been implemented in the ns-3 network simulator, given its complexity. Therefore, one of the contributions of this work is to present an implementation of diversity reception for ns-3 where a static linear chain topology network and a more realistic mobility network are evaluated. The evaluation shows significant improvements in network transit time and packet delivery ratio when diversity reception is applied.
