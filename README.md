# MRC_diversity_reception
Mobile Ad-hoc Networks exhibit a limited wireless transmission range due to the interference present in the channel and the packets lost due to transmission errors. In this work, we evaluate the diversity reception technique to overcome the problems that arise with these networks, given their wireless nature. Diversity reception is a common technique in many radio communication systems, fixed or mobile, which improves signal reception quality. We use a single Nakagami-m channel to model the resulting received signal after using Maximum Ratio Combining (MRC) to the copies of the transmitted signal. 

In this repository, we implement the MRC diversity reception over the Nakagami-m channel. The proposal is implemented in the ns-3 network simulator, to the best of our knowledge, the implementation of MRC diversity reception for ns-3 has not been published in the open technical literature because the resulting channel model is usually complicated to obtain through a closed formula.
